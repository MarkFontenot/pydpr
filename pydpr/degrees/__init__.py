'''
The idea here is to provide the simplest interface to creating a degree.  Users would type

  degree = dpr.degrees.create("DEGREE CODE", "SPECIALIZATION CODE")

And they will get a completely-populated degree.  Each file in this directory should:

(1) define a degree with the same name as the file.
(2) define any pre-check functions required before analysis.
(3) define any department-specific post-check red flag conditions.
(4) provide a function called create() that returns a populated degree object.

#def create(degree_code, spec_code=None):
#
#  pass
